A user is an address that has interacted with at least one Sablier contract.

This includes:

- Stream creators and senders
- Stream recipients
- Airdrop creators and claimers
- Anyone who withdraws from streams or claims airdrops on behalf of others

- Only implemented in Envio.
- This is an internal entity we use for analytics. It's not used in the Sablier UI.
