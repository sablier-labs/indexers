"""
A user is an address that has interacted with at least one Sablier contract.

This includes:

- Stream creators and senders
- Stream recipients
- Airdrop creators and claimers
- Anyone who withdraws from streams or claims airdrops on behalf of others

Notes:

- This is an internal entity we use for analytics. It's not used in the Sablier UI.
- Currently implemented only in Envio mappings.
- May be enhanced with derived relations in the future. See https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/issues/159
